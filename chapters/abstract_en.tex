This paper proposes a LaTeX-based bachelor's thesis template, aiming to provide students with a concise, elegant, and easy-to-use writing format. The template follows the relevant regulations of the university, including the structure of the thesis, font, and page layout, which can greatly improve the efficiency of thesis writing.

The template provides preset formats for common elements such as the thesis cover page, table of contents, abstract, and each chapter. Users only need to fill in the content in the corresponding positions. At the same time, the template also supports customized settings, such as adjusting page margins, font size, and line spacing, to meet the personalized needs of different students.

By using this LaTeX template, students can better focus on writing the content of the thesis, avoid the cumbersome formatting settings, and improve the overall quality of the thesis writing. This template has been widely applied at Jilin University (not actually the case) and has received unanimous praise from both teachers and students.
